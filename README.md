This repository, named CSS_GRID, demonstrates the use of CSS Grid to create organized layouts across five distinct HTML pages, each focusing on a different set of data: employees, actors, students, animals, and products. Every page employs a grid structure to display key information, such as employee IDs and salaries, actor profiles, student enrollments, animal categories, and product details. Built with HTML and CSS, this project highlights the flexibility of CSS Grid for visual data organization. Users can easily fork the repository, update the datasets, and view the grids by opening the HTML files in any browser. The repository also contains a detailed README file, offering insights into the projectâ€™s organization, the technologies utilized, and guidelines for contributing and using the project.
